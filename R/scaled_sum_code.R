#' Scaled sum coding
#'
#' This is also sometimes called simple, sum, or deviation coding depending on
#' the field and source. Use this to compare each level to a reference level.
#'
#' For n levels of factors, generate a matrix with n-1 comparisons where:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item Reference level = -1/n
#'  \item Comparison level = (n-1)/n
#'  \item All others = -1/n
#'}
#'
#' Example interpretation for a 4 level factor:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item Intercept = Grand mean (mean of the means of each level)
#'  \item grp2 = mean(grp2) - mean(grp1)
#'  \item grp3 = mean(grp3) - mean(grp1)
#'  \item grp4 = mean(grp4) - mean(grp1)
#'}
#' Note: grp coefficient estimates are the same as with contr.treatment, but
#' the intercept is changed to the grand mean instead of the mean of grp1.
#'
#' IMPORTANT: This coding scheme is NOT the same as contr.sum/2 when the number
#' of levels is GREATER than 2. When k=2, estimates with contr.sum can be interpreted
#' as "half the distance between levels" but when k>2, contr.sum is to be interpreted
#' as "the distance between this level and the GRAND MEAN". You may be tempted
#' to use contr.sum(k)/2, but this tests the hypothesis that 3/2 times the mean
#' of a level is equal to half the sum of the means of the other levels, i.e.,
#' 1.5mu1 - .5mu2 - .5mu3 - .5mu4 = 0. I'm not sure when this would be useful.
