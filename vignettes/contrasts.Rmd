This vignette describes some of the contrast coding helpers this package provides.
It should be noted that this package does not seek to provide an interface for
creating hypothesis matrices and their respective contrast matrices. For that
functionality you might look into the `multcomp` or `hypr` packages. The contrast
functionality of this package is focused on the following:

- Easily implement commonly used contrast coding schemes
- Make reference levels explicit
- Cut down on repetitive coding involved in setting contrasts
- Retain interpretable labels in model summary coefficients
- Allow the implementation of custom contrasts (but again not their creation)

This vignette will not go into detail how different contrast schemes are derived or
interpreted, but will describe some of the high level differences. I recommend
reading the following:

- [UCLA R Library Contrast Coding Systems for Categorical Variables](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/library/r-library-contrast-coding-systems-for-categorical-variables/)
- [How to capitalize on a priori contrasts in linear (mixed) models: A tutorial](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749596X19300695)

There is a very small overview of hypothesis matrices in the second to last
section, but I will not provide a discussion of orthogonality as it relates
to contrasts.

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(sostools)
library(dplyr)
library(MASS)
mdl_data <- 
  mtcars %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(cyl = factor(cyl), 
         twolevel = round(runif(n()),0),
         twolevel = ifelse(twolevel == 1, "a", "b"),
         twolevel = factor(twolevel),
         gear = factor(gear),
         carb = factor(carb))
```

## Motivation 

The default contrast scheme for factors in R is **treatment coding**, which tests
the difference between each level of a factor and the level set as the reference 
level. Often this doesn't correspond to hypotheses we want to test, so we need to 
change it ourselves.

```{r}
contrasts(mdl_data$twolevel)
contrasts(mdl_data$carb)
```

Typically we would change these manually using `contrasts<-`, for example
this would implement R's built in sum coding for a 6 level factor.

```{r}
contrasts(mdl_data$carb) <- contr.sum(6)
contrasts(mdl_data$carb)
```

Compare this contrast matrix to the treatment coded matrix previously shown
for this factor. There are two things to note here. First, in the treatment
coded matrix the *first row* corresponding to level 1 was all 0, denoting 1 as
the reference level, but here the reference level is actually level 8, which has
all -1s. This may not be what you intended.
Second, the **column names have changed**. The column names represent the labels
for the comparisons we're making with our contrast matrix. In the treatment
coded matrix, the labels are `c(2, 3, 4, 6, 8)`, which would be shown in the
coefficient names in a model summary. In the matrix from `contr.sum(6)`, they're
not the same. Notably, what would correspond to the comparison for level 6 would
be displayed as `carb5` in our model output! We'd like to have meaningful labels
that make it easier to interpret.

Occasionally people will mention that there's a "standard", "tradition", or
"convention" that `coef1` corresponds to something. This isn't really the case,
it's only a "convention" because people are unknowingly erasing or not setting
the labels themselves. There's no reason to need to keep track of what 1 represents
for all your categorical variables in your head, as you'll likely make a mistake.

```{r reset, echo = FALSE}
mdl_data <- 
  mtcars %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(cyl = factor(cyl), 
         twolevel = round(runif(n()),0),
         twolevel = ifelse(twolevel == 1, "a", "b"),
         twolevel = factor(twolevel),
         gear = factor(gear),
         carb = factor(carb))
```

## Contrast coding 

This package provides a useful function called `contrast_code()` which takes
a factor column and a desired contrast scheme and returns a new contrast matrix.
The contrast scheme can be passed as either a function that generates contrast
matrices, such as `contr.sum`, or a matrix you've created yourself.

```{r}
contrast_code(mdl_data$carb, contr.sum)
```

There are two things to note here. First, the comparison labels have been retained.
This makes model intepretation easier. Second, the reference level has been
set to the first level alphabetically, rather than the last level. This is
the default behavior, but can be set to whatever you want.

```{r}
contrast_code(mdl_data$carb, contr.sum, reference_level = 4)
```

Note how the comparison labels have also changed appropriately.

The setting of reference levels only applies to schemes that utilize a reference
level. These include the following functions:

- `contr.sum`: compare each non-reference level to the grand mean
- `contr.treatment`: compare each level to the reference level (intercept = mean of reference level)
- `scaled_sum_code`: compare each level to the reference level (intercept = grand mean)

The following schemes depend on a particular order of factors. By default,
R orders levels alphabetically. If this isn't what you want, use `levels<-` to
change the ordering manually before applying contrasts coding.

- `forward_difference_code`: compare each level k to level k+1 (eg 1-2, 2-3)
- `backward_difference_code`: compare each level k to level k-1 (eg 3-2, 2-1)
- `helmert_code`: compare each level k to the mean of all levels above it (eg >1, >2)
- `reverse_helmert_code`: compare each level k to the mean of all levels below if (eg <2, <3)

Orthogonal polynomial contrasts with `contr.poly` are typically used to identify
trends in ordinal predictors. In fact, just as `contr.treatment` is the default
contrast setting for unordered factors in R, `contr.poly` is the default for
ordered factors. Nonetheless, orthogonal polynomial contrasts aren't used
for group comparisons, so the "comparison" labels are different. But this isn't
an issue, and will still work as expected.

```{r}
contrast_code(mdl_data$carb, contr.poly)
```

## Utilizing `contrasts` argument in model functions

Rather than manually setting the contrasts on the data frame itself, you can
also utilize the contrasts argument in functions like `lm`, which take a named
list of contrast matrices where the names correspond to factor predictors. This
package provides a function `enlist_contrasts` to take advantage of this. Make
sure your model fitting function supports this argument, as `brm` does not use this
(see the next section for a workaround).

```{r}
my_contrasts <- 
  enlist_contrasts(mdl_data,
                   cyl ~ contr.sum + 6, # Set the reference level with + ___
                   twolevel ~ scaled_sum_code + "a",
                   gear ~ forward_difference_code,
                   carb ~ helmert_code)

my_model <- lm(mpg ~ cyl + twolevel + gear + carb, 
               data = mdl_data,  
               contrasts = my_contrasts)

summary(my_model)
```

The left hand side of each formula in `enlist_contrasts` should be the unquoted
name of a factor column, and the right hand side should be of the following:

- An unquoted function name that generates contrast matrices
- ***OR*** An unquoted variable name that's assigned to a contrast matrix
- ***OR*** A `matrix()` call, which will be captured and evaluated
- ***AND*** An optional reference level when applicable, following a `+`. String
names should be quoted, if the label happens to be numeric you can leave the number
unquoted. You can also use an unquoted variable name that contains the reference
level.
- **AND** An optional specification for which level to use as the intercept. Same
syntax as the reference level, see section titled "Changing Underlying Intercept"

When using this method you should set contrasts for all factors. You'll receive
a warning if you don't set one or more:

```{r}
contrast_list <- enlist_contrasts(mdl_data, carb ~ helmert_code)
```

## Setting multiple contrasts at once

As previously mentioned, the `brm` function from the `brms` package (used to
fit bayesian models) does not have a `contrasts` argument. This means we need
to set the contrasts on the dataframe itself. But, this doesn't mean we need
to revert to multiple `contrasts<-` lines. We can use `set_contrasts`, which
uses the same syntax as `enlist_contrasts` but returns a new copy of the dataframe
where the factor levels are set.

```{r}
mdl_data2 <- 
  set_contrasts(mdl_data,
                cyl ~ contr.sum + 6,
                twolevel ~ scaled_sum_code + "a",
                gear ~ forward_difference_code,
                carb ~ helmert_code)

# Compare
contrasts(mdl_data$carb)
contrasts(mdl_data2$carb) %>% fractions()
```

One other thing to know is that when calling `get_prior` or setting priors for
coefficients in general, `brms` actually changes the names slightly when prepping
the model for running in stan. For example, using backward difference coding gives
coefficient names like `2-1`, but this gets changed to `2M1`. If you're doing
programmatic setting of priors or something, it's something to keep in mind.

## Note about 2 level factors

Coding factors with only 2 levels is a bit tricky conceptually because there
is only one possible comparison you can make. Thus, many of the different coding
schemes end up being mathematically equivalent.

```{r}
helmert_code(2) # Compare k to >k
scaled_sum_code(2) # Compare k to reference level
forward_difference_code(2) # Compare k to k+1
```

In many introductions to contrast coding, the motivation for using `+/-.5` is
something like this:

- `0, 1` from `contr.treatment(2)` puts the intercept at the reference level, 
which we don't always want
- `-1, 1` from `-contr.sum(2)` keeps the same reference level and the intercept 
is now the grand mean, but this tests half the difference between levels
- `-.5, .5` from `-contr.sum(2)/2` scales the estimate so it tests the full 
difference between levels.

All of this is true, but it leads to an issue when naively extending this line
of thinking beyond 2 levels. That is, one might be tempted to use the following
matrix for "sum coding a 4 level factor"

```{r}
-contr.sum(4)/2
```

Yet, this contrast matrix ***does not*** test the hypotheses that $\mu_1=\mu_4$
and $\mu_2=\mu_4$ and $\mu_3=\mu_1$ in the same way that the 2 level matrix tested
$\mu_1=\mu_2$. Rather, it tests the hypothesis that 
$1.5\mu_1 =.5\mu_2+.5\mu_3 + .5\mu_4$ etc. To actually compare, and test the 
difference between, each level and the reference level, you need to use the 
following matrix, which this package provides a helper for:

```{r}
scaled_sum_code(4) %>% fractions()
```

We can verify this by looking at the hypothesis matrices.

```{r}
# Not what we want
matrix(c(1,1,1,1,-contr.sum(4)/2), nrow = 4) %>%
  t() %>% solve() %>% fractions()

# Actually what we want
matrix(c(1,1,1,1,scaled_sum_code(4)), nrow = 4) %>%
  t() %>% solve() %>% fractions()
```

Rather than thinking about "testing half the difference," framing things in terms
of the underlying hypothesis matrix being tested is more generalizable. Assume
level 1 is `A` (and is the reference level) and level 2 is `B` in these
descriptions:

- `0, 1` from `contr.treatment(2)` puts the intercept at the reference level
and tests the difference $\mu_B-\mu_A$. Each comparison tests a distance from
the reference level. We use the term *treatment coding*.
- `-1, 1` from `-contr.sum(2)` puts the intercept at the grand mean 
($GM=\frac{\mu_A+\mu_B}{2}$) and tests the difference $\mu_B - GM$. Each comparison
tests a distance from the grand mean. We use the term *sum coding*
- `-.5, .5` from `-contr.sum(2)/2` puts the intercept at the grand mean and 
tests the difference $\mu_B - \mu_A$. Each comparison tests a distance from
the reference level. We use the term *scaled sum coding*.

It's worth noting that the terms "sum coding" and "scaled sum coding" are
***not*** consistent across disciplines. Other terms that are used are simple
coding, deviation coding, sum to zero coding, and contrast coding. I recommend
that you choose a term from your discipline and stick to it, but also provide
the exact contrast or hypothesis matrices in an appendix, preregistration, or
supplementary material. 

## Changing Underlying Intercept

I know I said I wouldn't give a discussion on how contrasts are derived
matrices, but there's one additional functionality that kind of necessitates
describing the process a little. We know that contrast matrices have $k$ rows
and $k-1$ columns for our $k-1$ comparisons (derived from $k-1$ degrees of
freedom). But models also give an intercept term: where does that come from?
Moreover, why is it conveniently the grand mean for basically everything but
treatment coding? What if I wanted a particular coding scheme for my level
comparisons, but the intercept representing the mean of my highest level rather
than the grand mean (which might not be meaningful)? Is this possible?

First, recall that scaled sum coding puts the intercept at the grand mean and
the comparisons are between the reference level and the level being compared.

```{r}
fractions(scaled_sum_code(4))
```

The intercept in this case is actually represented by an omitted column of 1s

```{r}
matrix(c(rep(1,4),
         scaled_sum_code(4)),
       nrow = 4) %>% fractions()
```

Why are there fractions though? If I'm comparing level 1 to level 2, why aren't
the others 0? Why aren't they just 0 compared to 1, like in treatment coding? This
intuition is actually valid; not at the level of the contrasts but at the level
of the hypotheses you want to test. Turns out those hypotheses actually underlie
this matrix, and linear algebra transformations can be used to go between the two.
For more details, see the paper on capitalizing on a priori contrasts. For now
just know that we can take the inverse of the transpose of a matrix to go between
the two.

```{r}
contrast_matrix <- 
  matrix(c(rep(1,4),
           scaled_sum_code(4)),
         nrow = 4)

hypothesis_matrix <- solve(t(contrast_matrix))

fractions(hypothesis_matrix)
```

This gives us our hypothesis matrix, and we can tell from the first column that
the intercept is the grand mean because each level contributes to a single value.
That is, the sum of the means of our 4 levels, divided by 4, is the grand mean;
hence the weight of each mean is 1/4. Our comparisons show that we're comparing
the fourth level (all -1s) to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd levels for our three 
comparisons. This is maybe more transparent than the 3/4 and -1/4s in the contrast
matrix.

However, consider if we didn't want the grand mean. What if we wanted the
intercept to be a particular level's mean, say our reference level of 4? Rather
than having each level contribute to the intercept, we just want 1. So we can use
this matrix:

```{r}
hypothesis_matrix2 <- hypothesis_matrix
hypothesis_matrix2[,1] <- c(0,0,0,1)
hypothesis_matrix2
```

Think critically here: Our intercept is now the mean of level 4, the other levels
don't contribute to it. Each comparison is now the difference between a level and
the reference level. If that's the case, we should have just recreated treatment
coding! But we need to convert from our hypothesis matrix to the contrast matrix.
Remind yourself what the contrast matrix from treatment coding should look 
like before proceeding.

```{r}
# Inverse of the transpose, remove the first column to get contrasts
maybe_treatment_contrasts <- solve(t(hypothesis_matrix2))[,2:4]

# I'm manually reordering to make the reference level the 4th level here
definitely_treatment_contrasts <- unname(contr.treatment(4)[c(2,3,4,1),])

maybe_treatment_contrasts
definitely_treatment_contrasts

# Moment of truth: Are they the same?!
all(maybe_treatment_contrasts == definitely_treatment_contrasts)
```

And indeed we recreated treatment coding by changing the underlying hypothesis
matrix. That was so much work to get something already available. Consider
a harder case of forward difference coding with the intercept changed.

```{r}
forward_contrasts <- forward_difference_code(6)
forward_hypotheses <- 
  matrix(c(rep(1,6), forward_contrasts), nrow = 6) %>% t() %>% solve()

fractions(forward_contrasts)
fractions(forward_hypotheses)
```

Now we'll change the intercept to level 6.

```{r}
new_forward_hypotheses <- forward_hypotheses
new_forward_hypotheses[,1] <- c(0,0,0,0,0,1)
new_forward_hypotheses

new_forward_contrasts <- solve(t(new_forward_hypotheses))[,2:6]
new_forward_contrasts
```

The matrix changed pretty substantially compared to before, even though all
we changed was the intercept. This still required quite a few steps to just
change the level we want to be the intercept. Thankfully `enlist_contrasts`
and related functions `set_contrasts`, `contrast_code`, and `functional_code`
have an argument to change this more simply. 

The syntax for `enlist_contrasts` and `set_contrasts` requires putting a `*`
before the name of the level you want to use. If you're using a reference level,
you can also specify that with `+` as usual. You can also use both, but specifying
a reference level is only applicable to schemes where that's meaningful, like
in `contr.treatment`, `contr.sum`, and `scaled_sum_code`. Recall from our earlier
derivation that scaled sum coding with the intercept specified as the reference
level is equivalent to treatment coding, which should be evident here.

```{r}
enlist_contrasts(mdl_data, 
                 carb ~ forward_difference_code * 8,
                 gear ~ scaled_sum_code + 4 * 4)
```

Using the singular `contrast_code` just requires specifying the `reference_level`
and `set_intercept` arguments as needed.

```{r}
contrast_code(mdl_data$gear, 
              scaled_sum_code, 
              reference_level = 4, 
              set_intercept = 4)
```

This functionality should only be used when you're using a function to generate
contrasts. Currently, I don't allow for multiple levels to be used as the intercept
(e.g., only 2 of 4 levels). If you really think you need to do that, you probably
have a good handle on contrasts and hypothesis matrices, so you should specify
the matrix manually yourself and use that as an argument. If you think you need
to do that but you *don't* have a good handle on contrasts and hypothesis matrices,
you should go back and read the paper cited at the top of this vignette again.
Remember that when setting matrices yourself, you should specify the row names
to be your factor levels and your column names to be informative comparison 
labels.

# Conclusion

Hopefully this vignette highlighted some useful functionality available in this
package. It does presuppose that you know a bit about what each scheme does. But,
looking at the documentation for each function provides a bit of help about
how to interpret fixed effects, eg `?scaled_sum_code`. The interpretation
of interaction terms is more complicated and beyond the scope of this vignette,
so choose your contrasts and models wisely!
