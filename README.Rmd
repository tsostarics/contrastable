This is just a collection of functions I use in my research that I use
frequently. Other functions I use infrequently can be found in my `snippets`
repo. Since a lot of this is stuff that I use for my personal work,
it's not guaranteed to work flawlessly in other contexts.The contrast coding 
functions however are fairly general and will likely be exported into its own 
package in the future once I feel it's ready.  

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tsostarics/contrastable", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Contrast coding functionality

See the `contrasts` vignette with `vignette('contrasts', 'contrastable')`.
